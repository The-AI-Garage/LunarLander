# LunarLander

This a Reinforcement Learning small project.ðŸ¤–

The notebook contains two algorithms for solving the task of "Lunar lander v2" from Gymnasium. In this way, task is to **land correctly on the Moon** ðŸŒ•. For this porpuse, I used PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and DQN (Deep Q Network).

This Notebook is part of [Deep Reinforcement Learning course from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit1/hands-on). However, the main idea of this small project is to spin up my first RL agent and learn from the 2 algorithms mentioned above.

On hugging face hub you can check [my model](https://huggingface.co/cyborcat/LunarLander).
Below you can **visualize my agent playing** ðŸ‘€ ðŸŽ®
